## This is me…

Engineer, tinkerer, bookworm, tech enthusiast.

I’m based in Nigeria, currently working as a software engineer at Disney Streaming. I am the founder of the Amethyst game engine project and a couple other popular open source projects. I also have 7+ years of work experience at companies large and small; you can get the full story on my LinkedIn.

I’m fascinated by challenging problems of all kinds, including (but not limited to) distributed and decentralized systems, embedded systems programming, computer graphics, programming languages, compiler design, and cryptography. I care about free and open source software, healthy and thriving communities, and leaving this world in a better state than I found it.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, check out my portfolio and résumé. You can also contact me via one of the communication channels below. I’m usually down for a cup of coffee! ☕
