My name is Samuel Chukwuzube. I go by @princemuel on most social networks
and no, I'm not a prince.

## About me

While what I do is programming and not coding, the name stuck with me long enough
that I'm not bothered by it any more.

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I have experience with both frontend and backend development,
with focus on responsive and accessible design, typescript and node.js.
