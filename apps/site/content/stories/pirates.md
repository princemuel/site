# From a Dream

We flinched!

It's a cold evening in August. The ground is mushy due to water from rain earlier in the day

There's is an unnatural silence, no birds or no insects sounds which were expected,
like the whole world waiting to take a breath.

That silence is broken again by the guttural roar and sputter of machine gun fire,
which makes us shudder...again. We is myself, my pals Bo and Rachel, and a few other stragglers
we picked up while trying to hide. Hughes, our other friend, has been missing since the gunfire started,
and I've been listening absentmindedly to Bo and Rachel have a silent argument
about going back for him.
Bo is all for going back for him, you know, 'leave no man behind all all', but Rachel says
we should go back when our group are out of danger...... I agree

Rachel is all for going back for Hughes, while Bo says we have to move the group to safety first,
then come back for our friend. I think Rachel might be secretly in love with Hughes,
but that's neither here nor there. I agree with Rachel, I want to go back immediately
but somehow, we've (tacitly? silently?...) been nominated as the group's defacto leaders. Well,
it was all we could do to calm down the twin sisters crying, stop the kids who wanted to run..
in such a way it'd have led them straight into (...)

The main gunfire is from a group called The Military. I think I've seen that name in
one of the history books in Minster Hall. The name is a relic of ages gone by,
(expand on this and explain why these military buffons are just mimicries, wannabes)

[Our escape route is almost through](phrasing). We just have to pass through the wide courtyard
which has seen many a game of hooky (old name hockey) and I've been silently pondering how to...
I've made a decision and tap Rachel's hand gently to release mine, as she has had a
(stranglehold, death grip) squeezing again in sync with the sound of gunfire....
