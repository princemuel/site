## Problem & Context

Describe the real-world constraint, the users, and why this project mattered. Keep it crisp and contextual — the rest of the document is the evidence.

## Research & Constraints

Key user insights from interviews and testing.
Technical constraints: platform, latency, budget, team size.
Business goals & success criteria**.**

## Design & Process

Walk through wireframes, flows, and the reasoning behind major decisions. Use visuals sparingly and caption them to explain the choice.

{/* Design exploration and options considered */}

Tip: use the gallery above to show process artifacts; they don't have to be pretty — they must be explanatory.

## Implementation

Give a succinct technical explanation: architecture diagram, major trade-offs, and notable code decisions.

### Architecture (short)

Serverless API for auth & ingestion, Rust worker for heavy lifting, Astro frontend for static pages.

Representative code

```ts
// Example: small snippet showing an important decision
async function fetchData(url) {
  // cache-first approach for the dashboard
  const cached = await caches.match(url);
  if (cached) return cached.json();
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();
  // small heuristic: trim large payloads
  return data.slice ? data.slice(0, 1000) : data;
}
```

## Pain Points & Tradeoffs

- Initial real-time approach increased costs; settled on a hybrid polling + event model.
- Complexity in auth flows slowed shipping — future improvement: unify auth SDK.
- Accessibility fixes required additional refactors for focus state consistency.

## Outcome & Metrics

Short storytelling: what changed, and how you measured it. Be honest about measurement quality and confidence intervals.

## Lessons & Next Steps

Summarize what you'd change, experiments you'd run next, and how you measure continued success.
