## About me

While what I do is programming and not coding, the name stuck with me long enough
that I'm not bothered by it any more.

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I have experience with both frontend and backend development,
with focus on responsive and accessible design, typescript and node.js.

You can find my projects, personal work, blog and some social networks on the links below:
