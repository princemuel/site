![A Sample of my work](@/assets/media/images/sample.jpg)

## About me

While what I do is programming and not coding, the name stuck with me long enough
that I'm not bothered by it any more.

I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

I have experience with both frontend and backend development,
with focus on responsive and accessible design, typescript and node.js.

I'm on a journey to become a frontend web developer. I love building little projects, trying out
new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along the way. When I'm not at my desk, you'll
find me reading, playing my Ibanez guitar _Arabella_, hiking through the mountains, or
challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.

I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and hopefully inspire
anyone else who's learning to code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for
stopping by!
